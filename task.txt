Add Filters to your server.
First Filter - added to the /login url, checks a post request for a body that includes username and password, checks them against a repository, and if they are correct, issues a cookie
Second Filter - added to all other urls, checks to see if there is a cookie that shows they have authentication, and if they have not, sends a 401.
